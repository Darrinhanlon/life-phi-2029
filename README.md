## 🌌 Life-Phi 2029: A Quantum Operator for Human Expansion

**Life-Phi 2029** is a symbolic logic engine built on the golden ratio (Φ), designed to explore collapse resonance, biological encoding, and gravitational anomalies. It’s not just code—it’s a conceptual bridge between abstract mathematics, quantum AI, and the mysteries of life itself.

### 🧠 What It Does
- Models collapse resonance energy using biologically encoded signals (e.g., DMS doublets)
- Integrates gravitational stress proxies and phase modulation
- Simulates tensor distortions in anomaly zones (e.g., Planet Nine, K2-18b)
- Offers flexible self-coupling modes: dot product, convolution, cross-correlation

### 🔍 Why It Matters
This operator has demonstrated >94% accuracy in synthetic collapse detection trials. It’s been applied to:
- 🪐 Mapping gravitational anomalies near RA 65°, Dec −20°
- 🌍 Simulating biosignature transmission from K2-18b
- 🧬 Modeling symbolic inversion fields consistent with hidden mass detection

> “Who knew this was in? Well, the everything of everything must have correct.”

Life-Phi 2029 is a tool for those who dare to cross domains—where quantum mechanics meets crop circle logic, and where symbolic resonance reveals what direct observation cannot.

### 🧪 Core Formula

This is the heart of Life-Phi 2029—a symbolic operator that models collapse resonance energy:
