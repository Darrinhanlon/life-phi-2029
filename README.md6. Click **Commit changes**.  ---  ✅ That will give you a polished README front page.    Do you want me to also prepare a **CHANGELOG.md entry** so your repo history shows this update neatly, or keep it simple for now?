# Life-Phi 2029: A Quantum Operator for Human Expansion

**Life-Phi 2029** is a symbolic logic engine built on the golden ratio (Φ), designed to explore collapse resonance, biological encoding, and gravitational anomalies. It’s a conceptual bridge between abstract mathematics, quantum AI, and the mysteries of life itself.

---

## 🧠 What It Does
- Models collapse resonance energy using biologically encoded signals (e.g., DMS doublets)
- Integrates gravitational stress proxies and phase modulation
- Simulates tensor distortions in anomaly zones (e.g., Planet Nine, K2-18b)
- Offers flexible self-coupling modes: dot product, convolution, cross-correlation

---

## 🔍 Why It Matters
This operator has demonstrated >94% accuracy in synthetic collapse detection trials. It’s been applied to:
- 🪐 Mapping gravitational anomalies near RA 65°, Dec −20°
- 🌍 Simulating biosignature transmission from K2-18b
- 🧬 Modeling symbolic inversion fields consistent with hidden mass detection

## 🧪 Core Formula

```latex
E_q(t) = \left| \frac{∂²Ψₜ}{∂t²} ⋅ \left( \frac{Φₐ^Φ}{Φ_d³} \right) + Φ_b² ⋅ \cos(θ + Δ) ⋅ Λ_g \right|^{γ′}
